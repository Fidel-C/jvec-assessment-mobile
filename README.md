# Flutter Contact Manager

This is a Flutter app that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage their contacts. It utilizes the GetX state management package and the HTTP package for API communication.

Once you have Flutter and Dart installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Features

This Flutter app offers the following features:

- **Create**: Add new contacts with their information.
- **Read**: View a list of contacts with details.
- **Update**: Edit and update contact information.
- **Delete**: Remove contacts from the list.

The app provides a user-friendly interface to perform these operations with ease.

## State Management

The Flutter Contact Manager uses the GetX package for state management. GetX is a powerful state management solution that simplifies code, reduces boilerplate, and provides reactive programming.

## API Communication

For backend API communication, the app uses the HTTP package. Ensure that you have a working API with endpoints for CRUD operations. Modify the API endpoints as needed in the source code to connect to your backend.
